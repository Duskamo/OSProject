some of my most used git commands:

* to make changes visible to others
git add .	 - add all files you want to commit
git commit -m "<your message>"		 - commit your added files 
git push origin master 		- push files for everyone to see

* to get updates
git diff	- see the differences between commits
git pull origin master		- pull lastest version from github
